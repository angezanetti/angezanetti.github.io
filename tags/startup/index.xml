      <description>I spent the last 3 years in the startup ecosystem of the Silicon Valley. As an employee of a big company first. My mission then was to study the US market and to create a subsidiary there.
So my job suddenly went from Lead Developer to CTO, even CxO (I was the only one in charge on the US soil) so I did all the jobs needed in an early stage company: marketing, HR, tech, business strategy, and even Sales!</description>
