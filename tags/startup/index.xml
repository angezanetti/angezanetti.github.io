      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in the tech industry for more than 10 years now. I Started as a contractor, then worked in a big company.
I learned so much.
In tech, but also, thanks to the years I spent in the silicon valley, in marketing, product and strategy. So when I quit my last company, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to apply to a regular job. I did not want to be a freelancer either.</description>

      <description>I spent the last 3 years in the startup ecosystem of the Silicon Valley. As an employee of a big company first. My mission then was to study the US market and to create a subsidiary there.
So my job suddenly went from Lead Developer to CTO, even CxO (I was the only one in charge on the US soil) so I did all the jobs needed in an early stage company: marketing, HR, tech, business strategy, and even Sales!</description>
