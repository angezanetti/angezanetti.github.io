      <description>Last October, I started a new challenge: Build and ship 6 products in 6 months. I spent the previous 5 years in the startup ecosystem, spending all my time focusing on one product only, and I needed a change!
Objectives Learn faster than usual startups As I said, when you start a startup, you go all in. You are spending all your time on one product, focusing on one market.</description>

      <description>Idea validation This product idea came from a list I made for my previous project. That was a list of 100+ directories where you can post your startup.
I made it for myself, to expand the reach of the product I was working on. I sorted all the websites, removed dead links, tag them, and used it to promote our project. Then, I wondered if it can be useful for others and share it here and on Reddit.</description>

      <title>6 Projects in 6 Months Challenge</title>

      <description>I spent the last 10+yrs to code, and the last 4yrs in the startup ecosystem. During all that time I was focus on the product more than anything else. I need a change. I want to learn the other parts of building a product and I want something challenging!
So I decided to (try to) launch 6 products in the next 6 months!
I want to remove my developer bias As a coder, you always want to build stuff.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in the tech industry for more than 10 years now. I Started as a contractor, then worked in a big company.
I learned so much.
In tech, but also, thanks to the years I spent in the silicon valley, in marketing, product and strategy. So when I quit my last company, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to apply to a regular job. I did not want to be a freelancer either.</description>

      <title>Starting My Own Company</title>

      <description>I spent the last 3 years in the startup ecosystem of the Silicon Valley. As an employee of a big company first. My mission then was to study the US market and to create a subsidiary there.
So my job suddenly went from Lead Developer to CTO, even CxO (I was the only one in charge on the US soil) so I did all the jobs needed in an early stage company: marketing, HR, tech, business strategy, and even Sales!</description>
