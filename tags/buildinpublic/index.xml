      <description>Idea validation This product idea came from a list I made for my previous project. That was a list of 100+ directories where you can post your startup.
I made it for myself, to expand the reach of the product I was working on. I sorted all the websites, removed dead links, tag them, and used it to promote our project. Then, I wondered if it can be useful for others and share it here and on Reddit.</description>

      <description>I spent the last 10+yrs to code, and the last 4yrs in the startup ecosystem. During all that time I was focus on the product more than anything else. I need a change. I want to learn the other parts of building a product and I want something challenging!
So I decided to (try to) launch 6 products in the next 6 months!
I want to remove my developer bias As a coder, you always want to build stuff.</description>
