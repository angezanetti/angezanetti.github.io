      <description>I spent the last 10+yrs to code, and the last 4yrs in the startup ecosystem. During all that time I was focus on the product more than anything else. I need a change. I want to learn the other parts of building a product and I want something challenging!
So I decided to (try to) launch 6 products in the next 6 months!
I want to remove my developer bias As a coder, you always want to build stuff.</description>
