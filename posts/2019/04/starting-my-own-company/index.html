            <div class="post-content">
                

<p>I spent the last 3 years in the startup ecosystem of the Silicon Valley. As an employee of a big company first. My mission then was to study the US market and to create a subsidiary there.</p>

<p>So my job suddenly went from Lead Developer to CTO, even <code>CxO</code> (I was the only one in charge on the US soil) so I did all the jobs needed in an early stage company: marketing, HR, tech, business strategy, and even Sales! I did this for 2 years but they didn&rsquo;t want to push the Us company, so I quit.
Then I joined a <a href="https://blupods.com">startup</a> where I worked for the last 10 months.</p>

<h2 id="i-learned-so-much">I learned so much</h2>

<p>Being immersed in a new culture, within a <a href="http://therefiners.co">startup accelerator</a> with people from all over the planet and speaking about how to create companies, grow, and eventually succeed taught me a lot of things.</p>

<p>The most important one is: I LIKE THAT. I love thinking about fixing
problems, thinking of what product can help the customers, trying to create a
true vision to fix the world!</p>

<h2 id="i-like-to-design-systems">I like to design systems</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m a doer, I spend thousands of hours at coding, trying to explain to the machine what I want to create, how I what them to solve my (client&rsquo;s) issue. And I like that, I like to build, I like to design, to invent new things. I do this for years, probably since my 15yo.</p>

<p>What i truly understand during the last months in the Silicon Valley is:
Companies are systems. Systems you can design, build, hack, and crash. And this
is a game changer, I can switch my mind into a <code>building company mode</code> and it&rsquo;s
exciting!</p>

<h2 id="free-as-freedom">Free as freedom</h2>

<p>I spent the last 5 years as an employee, after 6 years of freelancing. I switch from freelance because, at this time, I wanted to have longer missions, I wanted to build more complex systems and build it in the long term. I was sick of the typical 3 weeks contracts. It was the right move at this time, I learned so much, it was a really, really, good experience.</p>

<p>But now, I miss my freedom, I want to be the one who drives. When you touch the
commands, and you liked it, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to move backward and sit down in
an employee position. I want to take strategical decisions, I want to
understand what&rsquo;s the sales strategy, understand how the marketing is made,
take decisions on the tech as well. I can not be a <code>coder</code> anymore, not only.
I love it, I love the tech, but I want more.</p>

<h2 id="my-own-company">My own company</h2>

<p>I want to build things, my own things.
The next few months will be focus on creating a company, with good friends of mine.
Trying to conquer the world, or, at least, trying to fix some problems and build our own boat to sail freely.</p>

<p>Oh, and maybe I&rsquo;ll blog again!</p>
